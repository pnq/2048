#History of 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Created by [gabrielecirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli) . [Play it here!](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

#Now...

Was fed up of wasting time on this game and Was frustrated to see people waste their valuable time on this game both in playing and hacking to create alternate versions of the game. Although some of the hacks are cool and innovative, most of them are really pathetic :sorry:

So created this game so that the you can play it one last time, WIN it and move on ...
